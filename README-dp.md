## My process

### What I learned

I learned to utilize the normal flow of the page while adding in flexbox when necessary. This ensured that the img and text areas were aligning properly with the parent box, the entire QR code section.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) - These are a great resource that helped me with most of my issues around forgetting the specific property names.
